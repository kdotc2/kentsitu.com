Hello, my name is Kent!

I'm currently freelancing and helping early-stage startups turn their conceptual ideas into great product experiences. I previously worked in ecommerce and digital marketing.

In my free time, I like to go on hikes/runs, play chess, and watch football. Go Niners! I enjoy exploring new places and learning about different cultures. I also like to learn and tinker with new technologies.

The best experiences in life are those that make you the most uncomfortable.
