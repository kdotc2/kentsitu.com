Hello, my name is Kent!

I'm currently freelancing and helping early-stage startups turn their conceptual ideas into great product experiences. I self-taught myself how to design digital products. The psychology and visual elements are what drew me in.Â I previously worked in ecommerce and digital marketing.

In my free time, I like to go on hikes/runs, play chess, and watch football. Go Niners! I enjoy exploring new places and learning about different cultures. I also like to learn and tinker with new technologies.

This website is to keep track of my work, and progress in learning how to code. I don't have a background in coding, only some basic html and css when I was in digital marketing. So bear with me as I learn and experiment on this website. Be warned that things might break or not work... 

Also, all opinions are my own and not associated with anyone that I've worked with.

The best experiences in life are those that make you the most uncomfortable.
