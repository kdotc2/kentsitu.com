## Overview

The team consisted of seven people and we built the product from zero to one. I worked with a product manager, a branding designer, and four engineers. My role was Lead Product Designer. I designed, prototyped, tested the screens and wrote the UX copy. I collaborated with the team on research, implementation, and QA. We launched an early version of the app in the App Store and will continue to iterate on features. The project took ten months.

## Problem

Food waste is a growing global problem that continues to affect the environment. Food production exceeds consumption and edible food is often thrown away. This comes from forgetting about its existence. And also, not knowing how to judge the expiration date of an item.

## Goals

1. Organize and track food inventory.
2. Create a less tedious process to add food items into inventory.
3. Help users better understand food and spending habits.

## Solution

We got a better understanding of food waste in the US by doing research and interviewing users. After seeing what features competitors already had, we were able to narrow our focus down. We decided on food inventory management and budgeting. I put together wireframes and iterated on them from feedback. We launched version 0.9 in the App Store.

## Receipt Scan Iteration

The receipt scan flow needed some updates. Users had trouble scanning their receipts. They couldn't add missing items from the scan. And the error alerts needed a copy update.

### Identify Opportunities

I went through our current scan flow and identified some areas where we could improve.
- Scan won't work until OCR (optical character recognition) recognizes receipt.
- Present error alert before photo capture.
- Let users know which items need required information.

### Design New Receipt Scan

After getting the screens and the copy down, I put together a prototype for testing. In this phase of testing, we didn't include the real-time errors. We decided it was better to do it in-house with different edge cases.

  <div className="m-auto pb-0 sm:pb-4">
    <div className="text-lg text-[#FFD968] font-semibold">Receipt Scan Updates</div>
    - Wider capture box for scan.
    - New error alerts and indicators.
    - Globally change purchase date.
    - Add missing item after scan.
    - Option to delete card and undo action.
  </div>

</div>

### Test Error Handling

We tested the live error handling in-house. We wanted to account for as many edge cases as we could. These included faded, wrinkled, and marked receipts. Also wanted to make sure the 80-90% threshold accuracy remained the same with the new changes. The decision was to stick with the two error alerts, and add more when needed.

  <div className="m-auto pb-0 sm:pb-4">
    <div className="text-lg text-[#FFD968] font-semibold">Error Handling Alerts</div>
    - Capture button disappears on errors.
    - Brightness error on dark background.
    - Adjust error when receipt is not recognized.

</div>

### Conclusion

After about a month of the updates, we saw improvements in our metrics. The new error alerts and disabled capture button prevented unnecessary photos. The updated UI and indicators also helped more users complete their receipt scan. We also reduced future cost by getting rid of unnecessary photos in storage.

## Item Card Iteration

Users were struggling with the swipe feature. The card design didn't provide us with enough flexibility. It wasn't designed wide enough for us to implement future features on our roadmap. About 28% of users were moving items to the expense report. A lot of them had no clue that this feature existed.

### Short-Term Tutorial Fix

The current item card didn't offer a swipe experience that users expected. The short-term fix was effective in that it increased the 28% number to about 53%. But there were still some complaints about the experience not being ideal.

<div className="projectImageGrid pt-4">

    ![Swipe for more actions tutorial screen](/images/work/ylli-item-card/tutorial3.png)

    ![Available options tutorial screen](/images/work/ylli-item-card/tutorial4.png)

</div>

### Focus On Native iOS

With the app being only in the App Store, the team agreed to focus on a native iOS design. The feedback from the short-term fix and seeing iOS 15's new swipe actions made it an easy decision. The goal was to make the swiping experience more natural. And to widen the click box, so there would be less misclicks.

### Design New Tutorial

Users struggled with a simple tutorial. We decided to make it a bit more interactive with animation guides and overlays. I created a simple tapping and sliding animation using After Effects.

  <VideoPlayer link="/videos/ylli-updated-tutorial.mp4" poster="/videos/ylli-updated-tutorial-poster.png" phone="iPhone13Pro" width="224" />
</div>

### Conclusion

We weren't able to implement all the changes.

- Instead of having users go through each step of the tutorial, we created a video to speed up some of the process. 
- Due to timing, we didn't update the undo button and left it as it was in the previous design. 
- The delete button wasn't implemented in this iteration.

But we did see a jump from 28% to 72%. While the redesign looks successful early on, we still need to continue monitoring it.
