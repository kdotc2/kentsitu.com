## Overview

The team consisted of three people. I worked with a product manager, and engineer to build the product. My role was Product Designer. I designed, prototyped, and tested the designs. I collaborated with the PM on research and the engineer on implementation. We launched our MVP in the App Store. The project took five months to complete.

## Problem

New and existing content is constantly recommended by peers. Looking for interesting content can be a time-consuming process. There aren't any good solutions or all-in-one apps to capture these recommendations. Each category type requires a different app (e.g., Netflix for TV/movies, Goodreads for books, and Spotify for podcasts).

## Goals

1. Reduce time spent researching for new content. 
2. Organize and consolidate recommendations. 
3. Launch and get early validation for our solution.

## Research & Explore Competitor Apps

To understand the market better, we used a survey and did a competitive analysis. We surveyed 52 people to find out which categories to prioritize. It also helped us find 20 competitor products to explore, which narrowed down to 12.

<div className="py-8">
  <span>![Top 4 categories out of 13](/static/images/catalist/survey.png)</span>
  <div className="text-xs text-center">Top 4 categories from a list of 13 from the survey</div>
</div>

Of the 12 products, we focused on four products with a similar goal of what we were trying to achieve. Use friends and trusted sources to help find new recommendations.

## Uncover Key Findings

All four products shared similar features. They used a list format to share and save recommendations. The categories—TV shows, movies, and books are all present in the apps. These were also the categories that we found to be highly requested during our survey. One thing to note is that all apps required an account to view content.

<div className="py-8">![Competitor analysis](/static/images/catalist/competitor-analysis.png)</div>

I synthesized our user research into four main categories. These key insights served as a foundation to help build a user-centric product. We prioritized and focused on these pain points. 
- Researching can be time-consuming and tedious. 
- Forget what friends and peers recommended. 
- No all in one app to help with sharing.

## Ideation & Focus On List Format

Before coming up with ideas, I organized a sitemap. We decided to put more emphasis on the list format as opposed to the individual interest types. We found that a list format could potentially solve our pain points above.

<div className="py-8">![Sitemap](/static/images/catalist/sitemap.png)</div>

After several iterations, I came up with the Lo-Fi wireframes below. I kept in mind that our core product would focus on users going through lists and their items. I wanted to make it easy to scan and go through each recommendation.

<div className="projectImageGrid">
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Discover screen](/static/images/catalist/wireframe1.png)
    </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![List screen](/static/images/catalist/wireframe2.png)
    </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Item screen](/static/images/catalist/wireframe3.png)
    </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Create list screen](/static/images/catalist/wireframe4.png)
    </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Favorites - list screen](/static/images/catalist/wireframe5.png)

  <div className="imageProp">

    </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Profile screen](/static/images/catalist/wireframe8.png)
    </div>
</div>

As I upgraded our wireframes to Hi-Fi screens, we were stuck on several different home screens. After some deliberation and feedback from users on our waiting list, we decided on the fourth one. English speakers read from left to right. The title straight across gave the user a more natural reading experience.

  </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Concept 4 screen](/static/images/catalist/concept4.png)
  </div>
</div>

## Process

The process leading up to the Hi-Fi prototype was more of an organic process, rather than a linear one. There was a lot of going back to previous steps, as we received feedback and added/removed features.

<div className="py-8">![Process](/static/images/catalist/process.png)</div>

## Test Hi-Fi Prototype

After gathering feedback and iterating the designs, I created a clickable Hi-Fi prototype. I asked ten participants to test the usability of our Hi-Fi prototype. They were able to perform most of the tasks.

## Handoff & Implementation

As the team and I started to implement the designs, we soon realized we couldn't implement everything. We prioritized features that users responded well towards and put together a MVP. We got rid of features such as chatting, filters, and the dining category.

<div className="projectImageGrid">
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Discover screen](/static/images/catalist/screen17.png)
  </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![List view screen](/static/images/catalist/screen18.png)
  </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Item view screen](/static/images/catalist/screen19.png)
  </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Create list screen](/static/images/catalist/screen20.png)
  </div>
</div>

For the sake of consistency, I put together some components. To help with contrast, I put an overlay over the background images and limited color usage. We also linked the font sizes to the OS dynamic text setting option to make the app more accessible.

  <div className="imageProp">

  </div>
  <div className="imageProp">
    ![Create list components](/static/images/catalist/components4.png)
  </div>
</div>

While launching, we had several hiccups. The main one being our app getting rejected from the App Store twice. We needed to have a report button on every screen that had user comments. We were able to patch up the issues and get our MVP approved for the App Store.

## MVP Validation

After about two months of launching our MVP in the App Store, we got decent traction. We used Google Analytics to track usage, which helped us early validate our MVP.

From our early research data, users usually looked for something to do every 2-3 days. This aligned with the DAU/WAU ratio we got from our MVP. Users were also spending an average of 6 minutes on the app versus 15 mins on the individual category apps. This meant that they were spending less time researching for content to consume.

One thing to note is that there are creators and followers. There are those who create lists to share with others, and those that follow lists to look for something to do. 41% of users created at least one list and 33% followed at least one list. This was a great sight to see because users were sharing and saving lists.

We were quite surprised when 29% of users completed at least one list. Our research data suggested more than half of the users would do it. Our hypothesis was that users didn't want to mark an item as complete, until they finished the entire series. Talking to a small group of users helped confirm this.

  </div>

## Next Steps & Reflection

The process of creating a product from zero to one with limited resources was eye-opening. We had to prioritize which features to focus on, and adapt to the different situations that came up. Overall, it was a great learning experience. It taught me how to evaluate tradeoffs and prioritization.

There are a bunch of things we can fix from our MVP, such as the complete or save features. We have a roadmap of features that we want to implement. We would like to continue digging into the data and scaling Catalist. But with limited resources and time, this project is currently on pause. The MVP is still live in the App Store.

Here are the key takeaways from this project:

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  1. <span className="font-semibold">Building a product from zero to one is tough.</span> There needs
  to be a good understanding of the domain and its competitors. It requires a lot of research and
  learning things that might not be design-related.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  2. <span className="font-semibold">Don't get ahead of yourself.</span> Having a plan is great, but
  things change. Be prepared to move on from ideas that required a lot of invested time.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  3. <span className="font-semibold">Communicate early to save time.</span> Interact and communicate
  designs with the engineering team early. This will prevent extra work, and help understand if a
  design is feasible.
</div>
