## Overview

I redesigned my portfolio website after a lot of procrastination. I learned and used Next.js and Tailwind CSS to build the website. I wrote about why I moved away from website builders to building my own website <a href="/notes/portfolio-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. I also wrote about the idea behind the design layout <a href="/notes/layout-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. There will likely be new features in the future, but for now I think it's at a good place.
