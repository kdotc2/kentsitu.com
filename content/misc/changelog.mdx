## Safari navbar hover bug
<div className="font-mono text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">January 3, 2023 </div>

While hovering over the NavBar links, it didn't work as intended for safari browsers. Putting `button` tag inside the `Link` tag helped the problem. Not sure if this is the best fix or if there's another solution.

## Home page scroll
<div className="font-mono text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">January 2, 2023 </div>
