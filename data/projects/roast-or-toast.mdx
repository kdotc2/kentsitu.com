## Overview

Roast or Toast is an ongoing side project where I am solo designing and developing the idea. The platform focuses on letting users share their content to get feedback. The content can be in the form of a copy of text, an image, or a website link.

## Goals

1. Design and build a responsive web app with accessbility in mind.
2. Continue learning and using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
3. Learn and use Firebase for the backend.

## The Idea

The idea came from my friend and I joking several years back. We thought that merging the subreddits, r/RoastMe and r/ToastMe into an app would be a fun idea. The domain roastortoast.me was shortly registered after that conversation. I created the mockups for the mobile app. But it was never used and the domain kept renewing every year. This year, I decided to follow through and put the domain to use.

## Progress

After about five months of learning, researching, and debugging, the web app is finally live at <a href="https:roastortoast.me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roast or Toast</a>. There's still a lot more to learn and debug. But in the meantime, here's what it can do so far. It's also usable on mobile.

1. Sign in with google or email (no password required).
2. Create a text, image, or link post.
3. Upvote posts and comments.
