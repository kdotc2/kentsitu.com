## Overview

The team consisted of five people. I worked with a product manager, and three engineers. My role was Lead Product Designer. I led the redesign by taking point on research, interaction design, and prototyping, and testing. I collaborated with the team on implementation and QA. The project took two and a half months.

## Problem

Users were struggling with the swipe feature. The card design didn't provide us with enough flexibility. It wasn't designed wide enough for us to implement future features on our roadmap.

## Goals

1. Redesign the inventory item card to provide flexibility for our long-term roadmap.
2. Make it easier to move items to expense report. 
3. Create a tutorial to guide users on the new changes.

## Process

Review the data, research best practices for iOS. Mockup and get feedback from stakeholders and users. Iterate and design new tutorial. Test and implement new designs.

### Short-Term Tutorial Fix

The current item card didn't offer a swipe experience that users expected. About 28% of users were moving items to the expense report. A lot of them had no clue that this feature existed. We implemented a short-term tutorial fix to guide users. This would give us some time to figure out a better long-term strategy.

<div className="projectImageGrid">

</div>

The short-term fix was effective in that it increased the 28% number to about 53%. But there were still some complaints about the experience not being ideal. Here were some of the quotes from the users.

> ​​​​​​The tutorial helped explain the feature better, but it's still hard to get the swipe options opened.

> It's a bit buggy, where sometimes swiping doesn't always reveal the options. The options also need to be wider as misclicks happen way too often.

> The tutorial was helpful, but the swiping didn't feel like a natural experience.

### Focus On Native iOS

With the app being only in the App Store, the team agreed to focus on a native iOS design. The feedback from the short-term fix and seeing iOS 15's new swipe actions made it an easy decision. The goal was to make the swiping experience more natural. And to widen the click box, so there would be less misclicks.

  </div>
</div>

Through each iteration, we maintained the same design elements. The click box now has a wider click radius. The Finished and Expired actions are on opposite swipes with labels. The edit action now occurs by tapping the item card. The undo message was also updated to include a better explanation.

### Get Feedback & Design New Tutorial

I put together a Hi-Fi prototype to get some internal feedback from several stakeholders. The general consensus among the stakeholders was that the new design was smoother. It also provided us more flexibility to add features from our roadmap.

    - Swipe right to mark item as finished.
    - Swipe left to mark item as expired.
    - Tap card to open item info screen.
    - Tap 'Delete Item' to delete card.
    - Tap 'Undo' to revert changes.

Before testing it with users, we still had one problem to tackle: the tutorial. From our previous testing, users struggled with a simple tutorial. So this time around, we decided to make it a bit more interactive with animation guides and overlays. I created a simple tapping and sliding animation using After Effects.

### Test Prototype With Updated Tutorial

I put the tutorial screens together, along with the animations, to create a tutorial prototype. I tested the Hi-Fi prototype without and with the tutorial. I asked 12 users to go through the changes. Half of the participants, in the prototype without a tutorial group struggled. They thought tapping the item card would give them the item marking options.

<div className="md:mx-20 py-4">![Test results](/static/images/work/ylli-item-card/test-results.png)</div>

Some of the participants mentioned that a skip button would be useful. The team discussed how existing users might want to skip the tutorial as well. So we decided to add a "Skip Tutorial" button to give users that option.

    <h2 className="text-3xl text-[#59A4F5] font-semibold dark:text-[#59A4F5]">Tutorial Updates</h2>
    - Added swipe and tap animations.
    - Added worded description for each step.

### Handoff & Implementation

The team decided not to implement all the changes. For developer handoff, we used Adobe XD's specs and commenting. For the animations, we used Lottie Files.

- Instead of having users go through each step of the tutorial, we created a video to speed up some of the process. 
- Due to timing, we didn't update the undo button and left it as it was in the previous design. 
- The delete button wasn't implemented in this iteration.

## Conclusion & Reflection

After the change, we saw an increase in users moving items to the expense report. It started at 28%, and jumped to 53% after the short term tutorial fix. Then when we redesigned the item card and updated the tutorial, that number jumped to 72%. While the redesign looks successful early on, we still need to continue monitoring it.

The redesign of the item card was a much needed task. The team was on the same page throughout the redesign until implementation. I thought the tutorial should have been more interactive, but we came up with a compromise. The steps of adding an item would be in video form, while the new swipe and delete feature would be interactive.

The team agreed that delaying both the undo and delete feature was the right move. I thought priority should have been higher for the delete button. Users didn't have the option of deleting a duplicate or incorrect item. The compromise was to move these two features to the highest priority for the next iteration.

Here are the key takeaways from this project:

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  1. <span className="font-semibold">Tradeoffs and disagreements will occur.</span> The goal is to get
  on the same page through compromise. Then come up with the best path forward.

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  2. <span className="font-semibold">It's okay if production doesn't match handoff.</span> Priorities
  and designs are always shifting. Document the inconsistencies and advocate for them to get fixed.
