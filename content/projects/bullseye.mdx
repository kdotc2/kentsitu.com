## Problem

There are plenty of dating apps to choose from and they have become very common in the dating scene. Friends have told me the struggles of connecting and conversing with interesting people. For this passion project, I decided to explore if those frustrations hold true to others.

## Goals & Role

My role was Product Designer and the timeline of this project was four weeks. There were two main objectives for this project. 
1. Create a familiar dating experience. 
2. Include a feature to help with conversations. 

## Process

I started by interviewing users to get a better understanding of their experience. I analyzed my findings to categorize and focus on pain points. Then I generated a user flow, along with a user journey to help map out the user experience. After that, I created Lo-Fi designs and tested them to gather insights for the Hi-Fi prototype. Finally, I was able to confirm my proposed solution by validating the designs with users.

### Research Dating Apps

I interviewed 12 single professionals ranging from the age of 23 – 36. I investigated which dating apps users used and what commonalities they struggled with.

### Synthesize & Create Personas

I synthesized my findings and discovered five different category types. Below are some quotes to help summarize the findings.

> Most conversations are bland and have no substance.

> Profiles and bios need to have a better standard.

> Photos are always the first impression of someone.

> Finding someone with similar interests is tough.

<div className="py-4">![Five categories.](/static/images/projects/bullseye/categories.png)</div>

Using the data from the interviews, I created two provisional personas. Both share similar goals and frustrations with the dating apps that they use.

</div>

### Explore Competitors & Map Out User Flow

I went through the four popular dating apps from my interviews—Bumble, Coffee Meets Bagel, Hinge, and Tinder. All dating apps share similar features. The profile screens had a similar layout with the photo being the most noticeable element. The like and dislike buttons are always within reach for the user.

<div className="projectImageGrid">

</div>

After going through the four popular apps, I constructed a user flow. One important thing to mention is that the red boxes isn't an indicator of failure. But a decision point for the user to either continue or take a break from the process. The process can also restart at any point in the flow if one user decides to ghost or ignore a match. Dating apps are a very repetitive process.

<div className="py-4">![User flow of app](/static/images/projects/bullseye/flow.png 'User Flow')</div>

Now that I had a better understanding of the structure of dating apps, I mapped out a user journey with a scenario. Michael decides to download another dating app. He wants to see if the experience is comparable to the other apps. He is looking for conversation and to connect with someone special.

<div className="py-4">![User journey map](/static/images/projects/bullseye/user-journey.png 'User Journey')</div>

I kept in mind of Michael's user journey. He had difficulties with conversations and complaints about profiles lacking content. While the current apps had prompts and statements to help, they lacked customization. This limited users from showing their personalities and created a lot of the same generic responses.

### Ideate & Test Early Ideas

After going through some iterations, I came up with a customizable interest feature. Users would select an interest and write a description about it. They won't have to answer the same generic prompts and statements everyone else got.

<div className="projectImageGrid">

    ![Wireframe edit interests](/static/images/projects/bullseye/wireframe8.png)

</div>

I converted my Lo-Fi designs into a Lo-Fi prototype. I asked five participants to go through a list of tasks. The key findings are below.

> While the photo bar was helpful in seeing a summary of the photos, the profile still lacked personal information about the person at first glance.

> Four of the participants found the interest bar useful in creating a more personalized profile and loved the customization element.

> Three of the participants found it difficult to change the interest photo.

I separated the interest descriptions and profile bio. I added an icon overlay over the interest photo, to help signal to users that edits can occur by tapping on it.

### Refine & Validate Hi-Fi Prototype

After updating the designs from the first test, I created a Hi-Fi prototype. I asked eight participants to test the new changes.

<div className="flex justify-center py-6">
  <Button link="https://xd.adobe.com/view/f6f16d35-99e9-41bf-80e8-f4277438b263-a3a2/" text="Hi-Fi Prototype" />
</div>

While all users were able to complete the like or dislike task for the Discover screen. Three weren't able to do it for the Like screen. They swiped the profiles instead of clicking on them.

## Conclusion & Reflection

After four weeks, I was able to validate my assumptions. I created an interest feature to show a user's personality. I understand that this feature doesn't guarantee conversations will occur. But during my testing, users found this feature to be helpful with conversations.

For future improvement, I would like to dive deeper into the photo element of dating apps. While attractiveness was a sought after trait, people also wanted meaningful conversations. They lacked the resources to create or maintain one. What would happen if I were to blur the images or even remove them? Would there be more focus on conversations?

The process was a good learning experience and I'm happy with the results. I was able to create a feature that users found value in. The main takeaway from this project is: <span className="keyTakeaways font-semibold">Never assume, always validate.</span> Make sure users are testing the designs.
