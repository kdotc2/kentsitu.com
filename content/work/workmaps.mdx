## Overview

My role was to design and develop features from zero to one for a responsive web app. I collaborated with engineers and designers on research and setting up the backend. My contribution led to increases in engagement and revenue.

## Features

Here are some of the impactful features that I designed and implemented. For develpoment, the tech stack used was Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. 

### 0 Result State

Users kept landing on a 0 result page without any content or CTAs. This feature introduced a 0 result state, where users could go to different slug pages to view more jobs. This led to a 100% increase on time spent on the website and 25% increase in revenue.

</div>

### Map/List View

This feature introduced the ability to switch from list view to map view and vice versa on mobile. It also included the ability to view employer cards and job descriptions on the map. The list view had a 28% increase in job link clicks and the map view had a 22% increase in job link clicks.

### Feedback Prompt

This feature introduced a feedback prompt when the thumbs down button gets clicked. We used it to collect user feedback on employers and their listed jobs. This helped us figure out which employers and jobs to prioritize.

### Sidebar Filters

The previous filters were behind an extra click at the top header. It got moved and updated to the sidebar. The updated filters led to an 95% increase in job applications, 14% more time spent on the website, and 34% increase in revenue.

</div>

### Job Description Summary

This feature updated job descriptions to include better section summaries. We used AI to summarize the long job descriptions into concise sections. This led to a 16% increase in job apply clicks and 11% increase in revenue.

### Mobile Search & Filters

This feature introduced an updated mobile search and filters. It improved the mobile search and filter experience. This led to a 30% increase in searches and 53% increase in filter interactions.

{/* ### Error Page

This feature introduced a much needed error page. When users got errors or if we were deploying for production, it would show a blank screen. This helped fixed this issue and help users reenter back to the website.

## Component System

I worked on the building blocks for a design system. It was something we needed so anyone can drag and drop their ideas into Figma without a designer.

## Reflection

There was a lot of features that made it to implementation. But, not all got a full release because it either got scrapped or didn't perform well in the A/B tests. 

Here are the key takeaways while working on this product:

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  1. <span className="font-semibold">The plan and roadmap is always adapting.</span> New and
  existing features can get delayed to a later release date. Continue to communicate and stay
  updated with what's happening.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  2. <span className="font-semibold">Designs fail and that is okay.</span> There is no such thing as
  a perfect solution, things can and will break during testing. Don't see it as a failure, but
  rather a lesson for the future.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  3. <span className="font-semibold">Change takes time.</span> Be persistent and continue building
  rapport. Never stop advocating for the user. But understand that the business side of things can
  slow things down.
</div>
