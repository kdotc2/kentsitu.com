## Updated Styles
<div className="font-mono text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">April 14, 2023 </div>

Updated the styling for the navbar and each of its tabs. Made it more consistent across each page. Added title of the tab name, along with a short description.

## Added Projects Tab
<div className="font-mono text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">March 31, 20233 </div>

Added a projects tab in the navbar to keep work and side projects separate. I wanted a place to keep track of my progress for different projects.

## Dark mode border not working

## Safari navbar hover bug
<div className="font-mono text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">January 3, 2023 </div>

While hovering over the NavBar links, it didn't work as intended for safari browsers. Putting `button` tag inside the `Link` tag helped the problem. Not sure if this is the best fix or if there's another solution.

## Home page scroll
<div className="font-mono text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">January 2, 2023 </div>

Fixed home page to center without scroll.
