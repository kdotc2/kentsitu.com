I've always wanted to design my own website. I've only ever used Squarespace and Adobe Portfolio, but played around with other builders like Webflow, Framer, Wix, etc. After spending about a month researching and looking at different templates, I finally made the move. Here are a few reasons why I decided it was time to move away from website builders.

- Lack of customization and control
- Poor support and update cycle
- Not very cost-effective for low-traffic site

Of course with the move, it meant I had to learn a lot of things I wasn't familiar with. I have a basic understanding of HTML & CSS and can usually figure out how to do something with Google. So it was going to take some time before I could build what I envisioned.

The one portfolio that I kept going back to was [Brian Lovin's](https://brianlovin.com). I enjoyed the way it was designed and organized. I found out that it was built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I knew that I needed some sort of template to help me practice and get a better understanding of those frameworks.

I stumbled upon [Timothy Lin's](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) blog template, which had all the frameworks I was looking to learn. There was a lot of googling and figuring out how to fix bugs/errors. I now understand why people have hundreds of tabs open... It was rough the first week of trying to understand the blog template.

I knew the site would be a work in progress and would probably never be complete. There's always something new to learn. This site will help me keep track of my progress and serve as a playground for me to test out ideas and try to implement new features.

I can now sort of prototype with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Still learning and figuring out TypeScript/JavaScript. I have a better understanding of building responsive websites. And I have a greater appreciation for developers and the way they problem solve. Some useful links that helped me navigate.
