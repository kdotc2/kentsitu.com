## Overview

The team consisted of three people. I worked with a product manager, and an engineer to build the product. My role was Product Designer. I designed, prototyped, and tested the designs. I collaborated with the product manager and engineer on research and implementation. We launched our MVP in the App Store. The project took five months to complete.

## Problem

New and existing content is constantly recommended by peers. Looking for interesting content can be a time-consuming process. There aren't any good solutions or all-in-one apps to capture these recommendations. Each category type requires a different app. For exampleâ€”Netflix for TV/movies, Goodreads for books, and Spotify for podcasts.

## Goals

1. Reduce time spent researching for new content. 
2. Organize and consolidate recommendations. 
3. Launch and get early validation for our solution.

## Solution

After speaking to users and exploring competitor apps, we identified pain points. I put together some designs and iterated over them after getting feedback. This prototype was the result.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 py-6 gap-4">
  <div className="m-auto pb-0 sm:pb-4">
    {/* <div className="flex py-2">
      <Button link="https://www.figma.com/proto/WHJWY7oH3GPv2ytojmFueg/Catalist" text="Clickable Prototype" />
    </div> */}
        <div className="text-lg text-[#FF8300] font-semibold">Utility App For Recommendations</div>
    - Sign up through a guided process.
    - View list and individual items.
    - Create lists and make edits.
    - Filter the discover feed.
    - Check notifications and start a chat.

## MVP Validation

After about two months of launching our MVP in the App Store, we got decent usage. We used Google Analytics to track usage, which helped us early validate our MVP.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 text-center md:grid-cols-4 gap-x-2">
  <div className="py-4">
    <div className="metricHeader text-[#FF8300]">43%</div>
    <p className="text-xs sm:text-base">DAU/ <br /> WAU</p>
  </div>
  <div className="py-4">
    <div className="metricHeader text-[#FF8300]">41%</div>
    <p className="text-xs sm:text-base">Users created <br /> at least one list</p>
  </div>
  <div className="py-4">
    <div className="metricHeader text-[#FF8300]">33%</div>
    <p className="text-xs sm:text-base">Users followed <br /> at least one list</p>
  </div>
  <div className="py-4">
    <div className="metricHeader text-[#FF8300]">29%</div>
    <p className="text-xs sm:text-base">Users completed <br /> at least one item</p>
  </div>
</div>

From our early research data, users usually looked for something to do every 2-3 days. This aligned with the DAU/WAU ratio we got from our MVP. Users were also spending an average of 6 minutes on the app versus 15 mins on the individual category apps. This meant that they were spending less time researching for content to consume.

One thing to note is that there are creators and followers. There are those who create lists to share with others, and those that follow lists to look for something to do. 41% of users created at least one list and 33% followed at least one list. This was a great sight to see because users were sharing and saving lists.

We were quite surprised when 29% of users completed at least one list. Our research data suggested more than half of the users would do it. Our hypothesis was users not wanting to mark an item complete, until they finished the series. Talking to a small group of users helped confirm this.

## Next Steps & Reflection

The process of creating a product from zero to one with limited resources was eye-opening. We had to prioritize which features to focus on, and adapt to the different situations that came up. Overall, it was a great learning experience. It taught me how to evaluate tradeoffs and prioritization.

There are a bunch of things we can fix from our MVP, such as the complete or save features. We have a roadmap of features that we want to implement. We would like to continue digging into the data and scaling Catalist. But with limited resources and time, this project is currently on pause. The MVP is still live in the App Store.

Here are the key takeaways from this project:

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  1. <span className="font-semibold">Building a product from zero to one is tough.</span> There needs
  to be a good understanding of the domain and its competitors. It requires a lot of research and
  learning things that might not be design-related.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  2. <span className="font-semibold">Don't get ahead of yourself.</span> Having a plan is great, but
  things change. Be prepared to move on from ideas that required a lot of invested time.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  3. <span className="font-semibold">Communicate early to save time.</span> Interact and communicate
  designs with the engineering team early. This will prevent extra work, and help understand if a
  design is feasible.
