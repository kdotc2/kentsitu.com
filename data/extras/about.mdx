Hello, my name is Kent!

I'm currently freelancing and helping early-stage startups turn their conceptual ideas into great product experiences. I self-taught myself how to design digital products. The psychology and visual elements are what drew me in.Â I previously worked in ecommerce and digital marketing.

In my free time, I like to go on hikes/runs, play chess, and watch football. Go Niners! I enjoy exploring new places and learning about different cultures. I also like to learn and tinker with new technologies.

This website is to keep track of my work, and progress in learning how to code. I have working knowledge of HTML & CSS and took one intro to coding course in college. So bear with me as I learn and experiment on this website.

The best experiences in life are those that make you the most uncomfortable.
