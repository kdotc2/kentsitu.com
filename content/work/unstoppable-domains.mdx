## Overview

Unstoppable Domains is a provider of NFT domains, where users can purchase and mint (register) domains. The timeline for this project was three days. The requested deliverables were user journey map and Hi-Fi screens.

## Problem

Users who download the mobile app are not sure whether or not they are using the official Unstoppable Domains mobile app. (The web app looks different). Upon downloading the mobile app, users do not know where to start or how to properly navigate to take full advantage of the utility offered by the app.

## Process

There wasn't much time to go through the usual design process. I decided to interview one person and go through other apps. Then I mapped out the user journey and put together the screens.

### Gather Insights & Research Similar Apps

Since I had limited time, I decided to interview one person who is familiar with purchasing domains, but have no prior knowledge in the crpyto/NFT space. I went through the Unstoppable Domains app with this person to get an understanding of issues new users faced. We walked through the different features and buying/minting process of domains.

Since there weren't any known competitors, I looked at similar apps and referred to the Unstoppable Domains website. The apps that I focused on were GoDaddy and Namecheap. I wanted to see how well-known domain companies structured their apps and how it compared to their website.

### Map Out User Journey

I synthesized my findings into a user journey map. I mapped out the pain points that the person I talked to experienced. The mobile app lacked a lot of features that the website had. This opened up potential opportunities to improve the experience.

### Putting Together The Screens

Due to time constraints, I jump straight to the Hi-Fi screens. I moved the navigation from the hamburger menu to a bottom bar. Users couldn't search and purchase domains within the app, they had to go to the website. I added domain search and purchase functionalities to help with that issue.

## Conclusion & Reflection

Although the timeline for this project was short, I was able to learn how to manage time and make necessary adjustments. I was also able to gain a better understanding of the NFT domain space.

If I had more time, I would have validated the customer journey map with more data. I would have liked to spend more time talking to different user groups and exploring different screen designs. And then having those screens tested and validated.

Here are the key takeaways from this project:

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  1. <span className="font-semibold">Draw from past experiences.</span> Use past experiences to help
  figure out how to navigate around constraints. Then adjust the process to help manage time.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  2. <span className="font-semibold">Take advantage of available resources.</span> Use information that
  is available to the public. There isn't always a need to do extra work—especially if there's
  limited time.
</div>
