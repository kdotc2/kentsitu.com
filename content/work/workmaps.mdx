## Overview

My role was to design features from zero to one and develop the UI for a responsive web app. I collaborated with engineers and designers on research and setting up the backend. My contribution led to increases in engagement and revenue.

## Features

Here are some of the impactful features that I designed and implemented. For develpoment, the tech stack used was Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. Contact me to learn more about the process for each feature.

### 0 Result State

Users kept landing on a 0 result page without any content or CTAs. This feature introduced a 0 result state, where users could go to different slug pages to view more jobs.

<MetricsList
  items={[
    {
      icon: 'AppWindowMac',
      percentages: {  new: "100%" },
      description: 'increase in time spent on website.',
    },
    {
      icon: 'CircleDollarSign',
      percentages: {  new: "25%" },
      description: 'increase in overall revenue.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<div className="py-4">
  ![0 matching jobs screen](/images/work/workmaps/0-matching-jobs.webp)
</div>

### Map/List View

This feature introduced the ability to switch from list view to map view and vice versa on mobile. It also included the ability to view employer cards and job descriptions on the map.

<MetricsList
  items={[
    {
      icon: 'MousePointerClick',
      percentages: {  new: "28%" },
      description: 'increase in job link clicks for list view.',
    },
    {
      icon: 'MousePointerClick',
      percentages: {  new: "22%" },
      description: 'increase in job link clicks for map view.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<div className="projectImageGrid pt-4">

    {/* ![Store card screen](/images/work/workmaps/store-card.webp) */}

</div>

### Sidebar Filters

The previous filters were behind an extra click at the top header. After moving and updating the filters to the sidebar, we saw an increase in overall metrics.

<MetricsList
  items={[
    {
      icon: 'FilePen',
      percentages: {  new: "95%" },
      description: 'increase in job applications.',
    },
    {
      icon: 'AppWindowMac',
      percentages: {  new: "14%" },
      description: 'increase in time spent on website.',
    },
    {
      icon: 'CircleDollarSign',
      percentages: {  new: "34%" },
      description: 'increase in revenue.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<div className="py-4">
  ![Filter and job card screen](/images/work/workmaps/filters-job-card.webp)
</div>

<VideoPlayer title="workmaps-sidebar-filters" poster="/images/workmaps-sidebar-filters-poster.webp" />

### Job Description Summary

This feature updated job descriptions to include better section summaries. We used AI to summarize the long job descriptions into concise sections.

<MetricsList
  items={[
    {
      icon: 'MousePointerClick',
      percentages: {  new: "16%" },
      description: 'increase in job apply clicks.',
    },
    {
      icon: 'CircleDollarSign',
      percentages: {  new: "11%" },
      description: 'increase in revenue.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<div className="py-4">

</div>

<VideoPlayer title="workmaps-job-description-summary" poster="/images/workmaps-job-description-summary-poster.webp" />

### Mobile Search & Filters

This feature introduced an updated mobile search and filters. It improved the mobile search and filter experience.

<MetricsList
  items={[
    {
      icon: 'Search',
      percentages: {  new: "30%" },
      description: 'increase in job searches.',
    },
    {
      icon: 'ListFilter',
      percentages: {  new: "53%" },
      description: 'increase in filter interactions.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<div className="projectImageGrid pt-4">

    {/* ![Mobile list search screen](/images/work/workmaps/mobile-list-search.webp) */}

    <VideoPlayer title="workmaps-mobile-search-filters" poster="/images/workmaps-mobile-search-filters-poster.webp" />

</div>

{/* ### Feedback Prompt

This feature introduced a feedback prompt when the thumbs down button gets clicked. We used it to collect user feedback on employers and their listed jobs. The data points helped shaped the roadmap and helped prioritize employers and jobs.

<div className="py-4">
![Feedback prompt screen](/images/work/workmaps/store-card-feedback.webp)
</div> */}

{/* ### Error Page

This feature introduced a much needed error page. When users got errors or if we were deploying for production, it would show a blank screen. This helped fixed this issue and help users reenter back to the website.

<div className="py-4">
![Employer filters and job description screen](/images/work/workmaps/error-page.webp)
</div> */}

## Component System

I worked on the building blocks for a design system. It was something we needed so anyone can drag and drop their ideas into Figma without a designer.

## Reflection

There was a lot of features that made it to implementation. But, not all got a full release because it either got scrapped or didn't perform well in the A/B tests. 

Here are the key takeaways while working on this product:

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  1. <span className="font-semibold">The plan and roadmap is always adapting.</span> New and
  existing features can get delayed to a later release date. Continue to communicate and stay
  updated with what's happening.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  2. <span className="font-semibold">Designs fail and that is okay.</span> There is no such thing as
  a perfect solution, things can and will break during testing. Don't see it as a failure, but
  rather a lesson for the future.
</div>

<div className="keyTakeaways">
  3. <span className="font-semibold">Change takes time.</span> Be persistent and continue building
  rapport. Never stop advocating for the user. But understand that the business side of things can
  slow things down.
</div>
