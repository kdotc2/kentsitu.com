summary: Moving away from website builders and learning to build my own website.

_Updated to 2.0 (current site), the old design can be found <Link href={'/projects/portfolio-website'}>here</Link>._

I've always wanted to design my own website. I've only ever used Squarespace and Adobe Portfolio. Also, played around with other builders like Webflow, Framer, Wix, etc. I finally made the move after spending about a month researching. Here are a few reasons why I decided it was time to move away from website builders.

- Lack of customization and control
- Poor support and update cycle
- Not very cost-effective for low-traffic site

Of course with the move, it meant I had to learn a lot of things I wasn't familiar with. I have working knowledge of HTML & CSS and can usually figure out how to do something with Google. So it was going to take some time before I could build what I envisioned.

The one portfolio that I kept going back to was [Brian Lovin's](https://brianlovin.com). The design and organization of information was great. I found out that Next.js and Tailwind CSS were the frameworks used to build the site. I knew that I needed some sort of template to help me get a better understanding of those frameworks.

I stumbled upon [Timothy Lin's](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) blog template, which had all the frameworks I was looking to learn. There was a lot of googling and figuring out how to fix bugs/errors. I now understand why people have hundreds of tabs open... It was rough the first week of trying to understand the blog template.

I knew the site would be a work in progress and would probably never be complete. There's always something new to learn. This site will help me keep track of my progress. It will serve as a playground for testing ideas and trying to implement them. Below is the old site on the left and the new one on the right.

I can now sort of prototype with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Still learning and figuring out TypeScript/JavaScript. I have a better understanding of building responsive websites. And I have a greater appreciation for how developers problem solve. Some useful links that helped me navigate.
