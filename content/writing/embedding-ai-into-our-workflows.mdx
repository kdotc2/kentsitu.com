I recently had a conversation with June about AI, specifically about embedding it into daily workflows. From my limited experience, I know it can be useful when you ask the right questions. During the discussion, I focused on the negatives—the environmental impact, its questionable profitability, and etc. What didn't occur to me at the time was that none of those negatives are actually in my control, something the other person pointed out. As a consumer, it isn't my responsibility to care about them. That may sound a bit cynical, but what matters most is whether the product works when I use it.

AI has been especially useful when planning things or building the backend for side projects. As someone who's been working to improve my frontend skills, it's helped bridge the gap between design and implementation. It never felt right handing my designs off to someone else to build. And that's where I think AI can really thrive, as a tool that teaches and supports you in areas you're actively trying to improve in. While I'm more comfortable implementing my own designs now, AI made it much easier to reach the finish line when I was still building my knowledge.

I believe that, over time, design and frontend development will merge into a single role (part of the reason why I'm learning how to code). I've always felt that designers should be responsible for building their own designs, since they understand the intent behind them better than anyone else. Removing the handoff process reduces friction and saves both time and resources. A common counterargument is that one person shouldn't be responsible for two roles, but I think that framing is misleading. A hybrid role wouldn't mean doubling the workload, it would mean redefining the scope.

What feels more surprising to me is how resistant some designers are to this kind of change. Designers, should be willing to adapt rather than avoid. If AI is going to be embedded into our workflows, it makes more sense to get a head start than to wait and see what happens. The tools to learn how to implement our own designs are already available. Even if this shift doesn't fully materialize, the ability to build and understand our work more deeply is still valuable. Choosing not to adapt means falling behind when the shift inevitably happens.

And yes, this post used AI to help me structure and rearrange my ideas better.
