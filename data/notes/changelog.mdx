### Masonry Layout

There's quick way to do it with Tailwind CSS: `columns-2`. But the problem with this is that it didn't sort the dates from left to right. I discovered [React Masonry CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-masonry-css) by [Paul Collett](https://github.com/paulcollett) which helped solve the problem.

After installing it, I added this block of code to my `tailwind.css` file.

```js:tailwind.css
// to see list of all values, go to the React Masonry CSS link above
.my-masonry-grid {
  display: flex;
  width: auto;
  margin: -10px; /* gutter size offset */
}
.my-masonry-grid_column {
  padding: 10px; /* gutter size */
  background-clip: padding-box;
}

/* Style your items */
.my-masonry-grid_column > div { /* change div to reference your elements you put in <Masonry> */
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

Then added this my react component.

```js:index.tsx
import Masonry from 'react-masonry-css'

const breakpointColumnsObj = {
  default: 2, //default number of columns
  768: 1, //breakpoint of going to 1 column
}

<Masonry
  breakpointCols={breakpointColumnsObj}
  className="my-masonry-grid"
  columnClassName="my-masonry-grid_column"
>
...
</Masonry>
```

### Custom Styles For Tailwind CSS

Easily add custom styles to the `tailwind.css` file. Those styles can then be used globally without having to rewrite them.

```js:tailwind.css
// Example of my image grid
.projectImageGrid {
  @apply grid grid-cols-2 py-8 -m-2 sm:grid-cols-4;
}
```

I wanted to change the color scheme for border styles in dark mode. I applied the following under `@layer components`.

```js:tailwind.css
@layer components {
  .border,
  ... {
      @apply dark:border-gray-800;
  }
}
```

### Safari NavBar Hover Bug

While hovering over the NavBar links, it didn't work as intended for safari browsers. Putting `button` tag inside the `Link` tag helped the problem. Not sure if this is the best fix or if there's another solution. But this will do for now.

```js
<Link>
  <button>...</button>
</Link>
```

### Home Page & Footer Fix

The first problem was figuring out how to make the home page a one pager without scroll. Did some research and found that using `100vh` (viewport, height of browser) minus the navBar + footer helped solve the issue. The second problem was figuring out how to have the footer stay on the bottom of the page. When there isn't enough content to occupy the entire viewport, the footer goes up. Little did I realize the solution was to use `min-h` minus the navBar + footer.

```js
// height for my navBar is 60px & height for my footer is 80px (60px + 80px = 140px)

h-[calc(100vh-140px)] // used for home page to create a responsive page without a scroll
min-h-[calc(100vh-140px)] // used for pages with minimum content
```
