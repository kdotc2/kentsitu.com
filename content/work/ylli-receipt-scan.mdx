## Overview

The team consisted of four people. I worked with a product manager, and two engineers. My role was Lead Product Designer. I led the updated design by taking point on interaction design, prototyping, and testing. I collaborated with the team on research, implementation, and QA. The project took seven weeks.

## Problem

The receipt scan flow needed some updates. Users had trouble scanning their receipts. They were taking duplicate photos many times, which took up unnecessary storage space. They also couldn't add missing items from the scan. And the error alerts needed a copy update.

## Goals

1. Update and improve error handling messages.
2. Use UI elements to guide user through the receipt scan process.
3. Prevent capturing and reduce, unnecessary photos.

## Process

Analyze data and talk to users to pinpoint pain points. Identify opportunities and come up with solutions to solve the problem. Partner and collaborate with team to figure out viability and feasibility. Test ideas and implement updated designs.

### Analyze Data & Uncover Findings

The first thing that caught the team's eye was the storage usage for photos. When we dug deeper into the data, we noticed some important data points.

Our hypothesis on why was because of errors. The error only showed up after the receipt analysis, which wasn't ideal. This most likely meant that the users kept taking photos when it didn't work. When we spoke to users about this issue, they confirmed our suspicion.

> ​​​​​I kept getting an error even though my receipt was in clear view of the camera... I kept taking photos, hoping that it would go away.

> The receipt scan was pretty buggy at times. When it worked, it worked. But when it didn't, I would just close and restart the app.

> Some times, I had to take 5-6 photos of my receipt before it analyzed correctly. I wasn't sure if I was doing something wrong or if the scan didn't work properly.

### Identify Opportunities

I went through our current scan flow and identified some areas where we could improve.
- Scan won't work until OCR (optical character recognition) recognizes receipt.
- Present error alert before photo capture.
- Let users know which items need required information.

<div className="projectImageGrid">

    ![Camera scan screen](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/screen1.png)

    ![Review photos screen](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/screen2.png)

    ![Scan error screen](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/screen3.png)

    ![Items found screen](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/screen4.png)

</div>

I put together an updated user flow with two new error breakpoints. The first breakpoint prevents the user from capturing the photo if there's an error. This should prevent capturing unnecessary photos. The second breakpoint will let users know which items still need required information. This should signal to the user on the items that need updating.

![User flow](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/user-flow.png)

### Partner With Engineers On Ideation

The engineers and I discussed how the accuracy threshold for the scan was around 80-90%. And the two main analysis errors were brightness and blurriness. I came up with some different copies and decided on the two versions below. After some internal feedback, we decided on the short form error messages. It was easy to scan and straight to the point.

- Got rid of the "SAMPLE TEXT SIZE", as it was misleading. 
- Updated the capture box to accommodate for smaller device types. 
- Moved the alert to the center of the screen. Capture button disappears when error is active.

<div className="projectImageGrid">

    ![Adjust receipt error screen](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/screen6.png)

    ![Updated brightness error screen](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/screen7.png)

    ![Updated adjust receipt error screen](/static/images/work/ylli-receipt-scan/screen8.png)

</div>

I also made some updates to the second part of the scan flow. These features were missing in the first launch. And it made the scan difficult for users to complete. The item card got <a href={'/work/ylli-item-card'} target="_blank">redesigned</a> from a previous project.

- Added "Required information missing" alert, along with red dot indicators.
- Option to change Purchase Date for all items at once.
- Can now add missing items from the scan without having to wait or go back.

### Prototype & Test

After getting the screens and the copy down, I put together a prototype for testing. In this phase of testing, we didn't include the real-time errors. We decided it was better to do it in-house with different edge cases.

    - Wider capture box for scan.
    - New error alerts and indicators.
    - Globally change purchase date.
    - Add missing item after scan.
    - Option to delete card and undo action.

</div>

### Implementation

We tested the live error handling in-house. We wanted to account for as many edge cases as we could. These included faded, wrinkled, and marked receipts. Also wanted to make sure the 80-90% threshold accuracy remained the same with the new changes. The decision was to stick with the two error alerts, and add more when needed.

  <div className="m-auto pb-0 sm:pb-4">
    <div className="text-lg text-[#FFD968] font-semibold">Error Handling Alerts</div>
    - Capture button disappears on errors.
    - Brightness error on dark background.
    - Adjust error when receipt is not recognized.

## Conclusion & Reflection

After about a month of the updates, we saw improvements in our metrics. The new error alerts and disabled capture button prevented unnecessary photos. The updated UI and indicators also helped more users complete their receipt scan.

The receipt scan feature is one of our core features. It makes adding items a lot easier and more efficient. Being able to improve the experience and metrics was an awesome sight. We also reduced future cost on the business of things by getting rid of unnecessary photos in storage.

Here are the key takeaways from this project:
