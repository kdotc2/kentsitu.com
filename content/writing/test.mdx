I recently had a conversation about AI in the context of embedding it into workflows. From my limited understanding and usage of AI, I know it can be helpful with the right questions. While I talked about the negatives of it—bad for environment, not making money, etc—It didn't occur to me that none of those things are in my control, until the other person pointed it out. As a consumer, it isn't my duty to care about those things. I know it sounds a bit cycnical but all I really care about is whether the product works when I use it. 

AI has been extremely helpful for me when I plan or to build the backend for a side project. As someone who's trying to get better at frontend, it's been very useful bridging that design and frontend knowledge gap. It never felt right when I had to give my designs for someone else to implement. I think there is where AI can thrive, teach and aid you on things you want to learn. While I'm better at implementing my own designs now, AI has made it a lot easier to get to the finish line in the past.

An unpopular take that I have is that in the future, design and frontend will merge into one role (part of the reason for my interest in learning how to code). I've always had this thought that designers should be in charge of building their designs because they know what they want. If we can bypass the handoff process, it'll save time and resources. One of the counter arguements is that one person shouldn't be doing two roles. I think the arguement is misleading because the hybrid role wouldn't be someone working 80 hours, it'll adjust accordingly.

It's a bit weird because I think designers should embrace change, not avoid it. If AI truly is the future and going to be embeded into our workflows, it's better to get a headstart now than wait to see what happens. The ability to learn how to implement our own designs is literally right in front of us. Even if it's not part of the future, at least we're able to learn someone new. If we don't adapt, we're going to be left behind.

 I've seen some unpopular takes on it and how we shouldn't rely on it, but I'm not so sure about that. I think the point of embedding it into your workflow is to make it easier for you to get reach your goal, not complete your goal for you. 



Just like in design, things aren't perfect on the first try. It takes a lot of iteration and feedback to get to a manageable state (I don't believe perfection exists). 

I think as a designer, I have this mentality of adapting whatever is thrown at you. And if you don't adapt to the current landscape, you'll be left behind. 


It didn't occur to me that while I support the usage of AI in workflows, that none of those things mattered

I am by no means against the usage of AI, I am all for it. 

What I learned from this conversation was pretty much, "If you don't adapt, you'll be left behind." As a designer, I completely agree with this take because
