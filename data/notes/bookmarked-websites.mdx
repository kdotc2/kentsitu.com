Blog template that helped me get started with learning and building the website. There are a bunch of other websites linked in the `README.md` file. It's a great way to explore and gather inspiration for your own website. Some of my favorites include:
- [Tszhong's Personal Website](https://honghong.me)
- [Parth Desai's Personal Blog](https://musing.vercel.app)
- [Thang Huu Vu's Website](https://www.thvu.dev/)


### [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com)

Love the layout of the website. The sidebar implementation is something I might consider adding in the future. It's a great way to organize information and navigate around the website.

### [Vyshnav Gangadharan](https://vyshnav.xyz)

Simple and responsive, looks amazing in any width sizes. The cover photos with the title, date, and description layout is a great way of showcasing information.

### [Rauno Freiberg](https://rauno.me/)

Very impressive website, reminds me of macOS with the bottom navbar interaction. The craft page is amazingly built with the clickable prototypes in real time. This is probably my favorite website. I absolutely love the interactive elements.

### [Shelia Leon](https://www.sheilaleon.tech)

Easy to scan layout and information is neatly packed together.

### [Robin Spielmann](https://www.iamrob.in/)

Have a very saas-like web app feeling. Easy to navigate and focus on the content.
